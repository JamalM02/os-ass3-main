 ˆ Assignment 3

 ˆ Oprating System

 ˆ Semester A Year 2024

 ˆ Total hours on the assignment: about 50 hours 

 ˆ In this assignment I used the Pthreads library to write some user level thread code that uses monitors.
   The main functionality of the program imitates a map-reduce longest words algorithm (parallel read and
   synchronization barriers). The goal of the assignment is to gain familiarity with the Pthreads library for
   user threads, monitors, and synchronization barriers.
